Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to develop machine learning models for a credit risk classification. The goal was to predict if a loan is high-risk (1) or healthy (0) based on the financial information provided. The data used in this analysis is financial information related to loans. The target variable is the "loan_status" column, with values 1 representing high-risk loans and 0 representing healthy loans.Logistic regression was used, but there appeared to be a bias towards healthy loans so the data was resampled and analysis was conducted again. The steps of the machine learning process are listed below. 

Machine Learning Process
-Read data from lending_data.csv.
-Split data into training and testing sets.
-Created labels (y) and features (X) for models.
-Logistic Regression done with original data.
-Addressed class imbalance by oversampling the training data using the RandomOverSampler function.
-Fit a logistic regression model for the resampled data.
-Evaluated the models' performances by generating classification report.

Results
Model 1: Original Data
Balanced Accuracy Score: High (0.99)
Precision and Recall Scores:
Healthy Loans (0): High precision, recall, and F1-scores.
High-Risk Loans (1): Slightly lower but still strong precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Model 2: Resampled Data
Balanced Accuracy Score: High (0.99)
Precision and Recall Scores:
Healthy Loans (0): High precision, recall, and F1-scores.
High-Risk Loans (1): Similar to Model 1, slightly lower but still strong precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Summary
Both models performed well, but the logistic regression model with resampled data slightly improved performance on high-risk loans. Given the small difference in results, either model is could be selected for a credit risk classification. Both models effectively handle imbalanced data and demonstrate high accuracy and precision for both loan types.
